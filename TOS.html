                <h3>13. Severability</h3>
                <p>13.1 <strong>Severability Clause.</strong> If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such unenforceability or invalidity will not render these Terms unenforceable or invalid as a whole. Instead, such provision will be changed and interpreted to best accomplish the objectives of such unenforceable or invalid provision within the limits of applicable law.</p>
                
                <p>13.2 <strong>Reformation.</strong> In the event that any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree that a court may reform such provision to the extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable while preserving its intent.

                <p>14.1 <strong>Governing Law.</strong> These Terms and any disputes arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Colorado, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law.</p>
                
                <p>14.2 <strong>Dispute Resolution.</strong> Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services will first be attempted to be resolved through friendly consultation between the parties.

            <div class="tos-section" id="revisions">
                <h3>8. Revisions and Changes</h3>
                <p>8.1 <strong>Revision Process.</strong> CodeCrafted Studios is committed to ensuring the Client's satisfaction with all Deliverables. The project proposal or statement of work will specify the number of revision rounds included in the project scope and fees.</p>
                
                <p>8.2 <strong>Scope of Revisions.</strong> Revisions are defined as minor adjustments to the Deliverables that do not fundamentally alter the agreed-upon scope, functionality, or design direction. Examples of revisions include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Text edits or content updates</li>
                    <li>Color adjustments</li>
                    <li>Layout refinements</li>
                    <li>Image replacements</li>
                    <li>Minor functionality adjustments</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>8.3 <strong>Change Requests.</strong> Changes that substantially alter the agreed-upon scope, functionality, or design direction are considered "Change Requests" rather than revisions. Examples of Change Requests include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Adding new pages or sections not in the original scope</li>
                    <li>Changing the fundamental design concept after approval</li>
                    <li>Adding new features or functionality not specified in the original requirements</li>
                    <li>Changing the technology stack or platform</li>
                    <li>Significant content reorganization after development has begun</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>8.4 <strong>Handling Change Requests.</strong> If the Client wishes to make a Change Request, the following process will apply:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The Client will submit the Change Request in writing to CodeCrafted Studios</li>
                    <li>CodeCrafted Studios will evaluate the Change Request and provide the Client with an estimate of any additional fees and timeline adjustments that would be required to implement the Change Request</li>
                    <li>The Client will review the estimate and provide written approval before CodeCrafted Studios proceeds with implementing the Change Request</li>
                    <li>Once approved, the Change Request will be incorporated into the project scope, and the project timeline and fees will be adjusted accordingly</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>8.5 <strong>Additional Revision Rounds.</strong> If the Client requires more revision rounds than are included in the project scope, additional revisions will be billed at CodeCrafted Studios' hourly rate as specified in the project proposal or statement of work.</p>
                
                <p>8.6 <strong>Revision Timeframe.</strong> To maintain project momentum, the Client agrees to provide all revision requests for a given milestone within the review period specified in the project timeline. Multiple sets of revisions submitted at different times within the same revision round may be treated as separate revision rounds.</p>
                
                <p>8.7 <strong>Final Approval.</strong> After all revisions have been completed, the Client will provide final written approval of the Deliverables. Once final approval has been given, any further changes will be treated as new Change Requests and may incur additional fees.</p>
                
                <p>8.8 <strong>Design Integrity.</strong> CodeCrafted Studios reserves the right to refuse any revision or Change Request that we believe would compromise the design quality, user experience, or technical integrity of the Deliverables. In such cases, we will work with the Client to find alternative solutions that meet the Client's needs while maintaining professional standards.</p>
